This repository contains various solutions for processing and visualization data sets, as well as building predictive models. In the ML's folder I used SVM, PCA, decision trees, gradient boosting, Linear, Ridge, Lasso and Logistic regression for data analisys. In Deep Learning's folder I used Keras for creating ANN, CNN and MLN.
