This repository contains various solutions for processing and visualization datasets, as well as predicting and classifying some attributes
from them. In the ML's folder I used SVM, PCA, decision trees, gradient boosting, Linear, Ridge, Lasso and Logistic regression. In Deep
Learning' folder I used Keras for creating ANN, CNN and MLN.
